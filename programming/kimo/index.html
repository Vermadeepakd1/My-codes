      Hi, I’m Deepak, a web development enthusiast and a lifelong learner. I’m
      passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites that can make
      a positive impact on the world. I have experience in HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and React, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies and
      frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science at IIITDM
      Kurnool, where I’m also involved in various clubs and activities. I enjoy
      collaborating with other students and mentors, and I’m always open to
      feedback and suggestions. My goal is to become a professional web
      developer who can create amazing websites and applications for different
      clients and users. I’m looking for opportunities to improve my skills and
      portfolio, and to work on challenging and meaningful projects.
